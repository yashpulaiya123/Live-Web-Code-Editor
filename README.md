# Live (Web) Code Editor

###### This project is a live HTML/CSS/JS multi-pane Code Editor that renders real-time output inside a sandboxed <iframe> for secure previewing. Developed with vanilla JavaScript, it uses DOM manipulation, input tracking, and dynamic code injection to instantly update the output as the user types. Template literals and scoped event architecture are used for efficient updates, ensuring a smooth editing workflow. The interface supports isolated execution of user code, making it ideal for learning, prototyping, and front-end experimentation.
